// Inbound ports (Driving ports) - Use case interfaces
//
// These ports define the interfaces that external adapters (e.g., CLI)
// use to interact with the application core.
//
// Currently, the application uses direct use case invocation instead of
// inbound ports, which is a valid hexagonal architecture pattern.
