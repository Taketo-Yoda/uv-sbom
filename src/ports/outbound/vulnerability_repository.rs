/// Port for fetching vulnerability information from external sources
///
/// This trait defines the interface for querying vulnerability databases
/// (e.g., OSV API) to check if packages have known security vulnerabilities.
///
/// # Security Considerations
/// - Implementations must not send internal/private package names to public APIs
/// - Implementations should implement rate limiting to prevent DoS
/// - Implementations should have timeout mechanisms
///
/// # Implementation Notes
/// - Use batch API calls when possible for efficiency (OSV API provides batch endpoint)
/// - Filter results to only include packages with vulnerabilities
/// - Empty result indicates no vulnerabilities found (not an error condition)
///
/// # Example
/// ```no_run
/// # use uv_sbom::ports::outbound::VulnerabilityRepository;
/// # use uv_sbom::sbom_generation::domain::Package;
/// # struct MockRepo;
/// # impl VulnerabilityRepository for MockRepo {
/// #     fn fetch_vulnerabilities(
/// #         &self,
/// #         packages: Vec<Package>,
/// #     ) -> uv_sbom::shared::Result<Vec<uv_sbom::sbom_generation::domain::vulnerability::PackageVulnerabilities>> {
/// #         Ok(vec![])
/// #     }
/// # }
/// # fn example() -> uv_sbom::shared::Result<()> {
/// # let repo = MockRepo;
/// let packages = vec![
///     Package::new("requests".to_string(), "2.31.0".to_string())?,
///     Package::new("urllib3".to_string(), "1.26.0".to_string())?,
/// ];
///
/// let vulnerabilities = repo.fetch_vulnerabilities(packages)?;
/// // vulnerabilities contains only packages with known vulnerabilities
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
// Note: This trait will be used in subsequent subtasks (Subtask 3-8) for CVE check implementation

    /// Vector of PackageVulnerabilities for packages that have vulnerabilities.

    /// Returns error if:
    /// - Network request fails
    /// - API response is invalid
    /// - Timeout occurs

    /// - Implementations should use batch API calls when possible for efficiency
    /// - Results should be filtered to only include packages with vulnerabilities

    /// # Performance
    /// - Batch requests are preferred over individual requests
    /// - Implementations should handle rate limiting gracefully
    /// - Timeouts should be reasonable (e.g., 30 seconds for batch requests)
